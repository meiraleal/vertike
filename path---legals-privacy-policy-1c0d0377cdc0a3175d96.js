In particular, when we process poll responses we create and assign a random ID which is stored on the user’s local storage in order to identify individual respondents and track their responses, whilst maintaining anonymity. Optionally, respondents may be asked by the poll creator for their email for further contact. This information is not linked to the respondent\'s answers or random ID.</p>\n<p>We may also monitor traffic, location and other data and information about visitors to our website for management purposes. Some of this data will be aggregated or statistical, which means that we will not be able to identify you individually.

If you request the right to data portability and it is not available to you we will let you know.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have the right in certain circumstances to object to processing of your Personal Data. If so, we shall stop processing your Personal Data unless we can demonstrate sufficient and compelling legitimate grounds for continuing the processing which override your own interests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have the right in certain circumstances not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, for example where a computer algorithm (rather than a person) makes decisions which affect your contractual rights.
