<h3>These terms and conditions</h3>
<p>These terms and conditions, together with any documents referred to in them (including our Website Terms of Use at <a href="http://doopoll.co/legals/terms-of-use">http://doopoll.co/legals/terms-of-use</a> and our Privacy and Cookie Policy at <a href="http://doopoll.co/legals/privacy-policy">http://doopoll.co/legals/privacy-policy</a>), are referred to together as our "T&#x26;Cs". Our T&#x26;Cs explain how you may use our "Site" (which includes this website, all associated web pages and any associated mobile applications or other software applications) and the services we offer through the Site (our "Services"). Our T&#x26;Cs also set out the legal rights and responsibilities that apply to us and to you, and certain key information required by law.</p>
<p>If you buy Services from us you agree to be legally bound by our T&#x26;Cs so it is your responsibility to familiarise yourself with them. If you have any questions about our T&#x26;Cs please let us know by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@doopoll.co">support@doopoll.co</a>.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change our T&#x26;Cs from time to time in accordance with the "Changes to our T&#x26;Cs" section below.</p>
<h3>Our services, Applications and Documentation</h3>
<p>The services we offer, together with the prices for these, are set out on the Site. The Services may change from time to time so please check the above link to make sure you are aware of the Services we offer.</p>
<p>We may make certain software or applications (together our "Applications") available to you as part of the Service. Where relevant, we may also provide documents or other information in whatever media, including electronically, (the "Documentation") to accompany the Services or Applications and help you get proper use out of them.</p>
<p>We shall ensure that the Services and any Applications or Documentation are provided with the degree of skill, care, prudence, efficiency, foresight and timeliness as would be reasonably expected of somebody in our position providing services similar to the Services.</p>
<p>Subject to your compliance with our T&#x26;Cs, we grant to you a non-transferable, non-exclusive licence to use the Site, together with applicable Applications and Documentation, to the extent necessary for you to receive the benefit of the Services in accordance with these T&#x26;Cs.</p>
<p>You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Services, including checking the compatibility of the Site and any Applications with the hardware and software you are using to access them.</p>
<p>We will try to keep disruptions to a minimum but we may suspend the Site or the Services from time to time to carry out maintenance and support work, and to investigate any unauthorised use in accordance with these T&#x26;Cs.</p>
<h3>Provision of Services and cancellation / termination by you</h3>
<p>Subject to your cancellation rights (for which see clause 9 below), we provide our Services on a subscription basis. The relevant subscription periods are set out on the Site and may be rolling contracts (i.e. contracts which automatically renew each month) or fixed-term contracts.</p>
<p>When we agree to provide Services to you we will do so for the applicable subscription period, subject to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>you may cancel the Services within the 14-day cancellation period by using the "close my account" option on your Account page, at which point your access to the Services will cease. If so, "Your right to cancel" section below will apply;</li>
<li>you may cancel the Services at any time after the end of the 14-day cancellation period by using the "close my account" option on your Account page. This will send us a cancellation request. We will review this request and confirm cancellation to you, or request further details from you if relevant. If you use the "close my account" option your access to the Services will cease and no further fees will be billed from you unless we confirm otherwise in writing (including email). No refund will be made of any subscription fees already paid by you unless we agree otherwise in writing (including email);</li>
<li>you may terminate your contract for Services with us under "Events beyond our control" and "Disputes" sections below; and</li>
<li>you may terminate your contract for Services with us immediately at any time by giving us notice in writing if we commit a severe breach of any of our obligations under these T&#x26;Cs and, if that breach is capable of remedy, we have failed to remedy that breach within 10 days after receiving written notice from you requiring us to remedy that breach.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have ordered Services under a rolling contract we will continue to provide Services to you for the applicable subscription period until you terminate your contract with us under the "Provision of Services and cancellation/termination by you" section.</p>
<p>If you have ordered Services under a fixed-term contract then your contract with us will automatically end at the end of the applicable subscription period and we will stop providing the Services to you at that time. We will contact you before the end of the applicable subscription period to notify you that your contract with us will shortly end. If you wish to renew a fixed-term contract you should let us know before the end of the applicable subscription period so we can process your renewal and avoid gaps in service provision.</p>
<p>If this contract ends or is terminated this will not affect our right to receive any money which you owe to us under this contract.</p>
<h3>Ordering Services from us</h3>
<p>You can order Services from us through an account on the Site (an "Account"). You will be asked to confirm that you accept our T&#x26;Cs when you request Services from us.</p>
<p>If we agree to provide you with the requested Services we will confirm this to you, either through the Site or by email. At this point a legally binding contract will be in place between you and us. It is therefore your responsibility to make sure that the details you submit to us are correct.</p>
<p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, not to provide Services to you. This may be due to technical constraints, because you or your business has been banned by us from using the Site or our Services, or for any other reason. If we do not agree to provide Services to you then no legally binding contract will exist between us, we will not be obliged to provide Services to you and you will not be obliged to pay us.</p>
<p>If there were any mistakes in the information you provided to us these can be corrected by accessing your Account and using the edit functions. If you have difficulty correcting your information please get in touch with us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@doopoll.co">support@doopoll.co</a>.</p>
<p>If you apply for an Account on behalf of somebody else, including companies or other individual persons (in each case the "Account Holder"), you must be authorised to do so. This means you must have permission to enter into a contract with us on behalf of the Account Holder since the contract will be legally binding on them.</p>
<h3>Fees and payment</h3>
<p>The fees for our Services are charged and payable in advance according to your applicable subscription plan. The amount of our subscription fees and the ways you can pay these are set out on our Site. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have provided us with complete and accurate billing information for paying the subscription fees.</p>
<p>Our fees are in pounds sterling (£)(GBP) and are inclusive of VAT, sales or other taxes that may apply from time to time.</p>
<p>You will be charged once a legally binding contract comes into existence between us (see "Ordering Services from us" section above).</p>
<p>The level of our fees may vary from time to time. Please visit the Site to check the rates currently applicable. Changes to your Account could also result in changes to the amount of fees that you need to pay. Any changes will take effect in the billing cycle for the next month.
We will do all that we reasonably can to ensure that all of the information you give us when paying for Services is secure. However, in the absence of negligence on our part, we will not be legally responsible to you for any loss that you may suffer if a third party gains unauthorised access to any information that you give us.</p>
<p>We shall be under no obligation to provide the Service to you if you fail to pay the subscription fees to us on time. If you fail to pay our fees then we will have the right to disable your Account and restrict your access to the Site and the Services. We will have no liability to you for any loss or damage arising as a result of any action we take under the "Fees and payment" clauses following your failure to pay our fees.</p>
<h3>‘Free trial’ periods</h3>
<p>We may offer ‘free trial’ periods from time to time. We will not charge for use of the Services during a ‘free trial’. However, unless we state otherwise in writing you are only entitled to benefit from one ‘free trial’. If you request more than one ‘free trial’ we will be entitled to charge you, and you will be liable to pay, subscription fees for all use of the Service that occurred after the end of the first ‘free trial’ period.</p>
<p>At the end of a ‘free trial’ we will automatically renew your account to a full, paid subscription and charge you subscription fees at the then-current rates unless we have agreed otherwise in writing, or if you have closed your account.</p>
<h3>Your right to cancel</h3>
<p>You have a statutory right to cancel your contract with us up to 14 calendar days after the start of it (i.e. the date we accept your application and start providing Services to you) without giving any reason. You can do so by using the "close my account" option on your Account page. If you do so you will be entitled to a full refund of any fees you have paid to us, except where we are allowed to keep such payments in accordance with these T&#x26;Cs (for example under the "Your right to cancel" section below). Refunds will be made without undue delay using the same means of payment as those used by you for the initial transaction.</p>
<p>Your right to cancel and receive a refund in accordance with the clause above expires after 14 days. You may still close your account after this time but you will not be entitled to a refund.
Under applicable law, we may not supply the Services to you until the 14–day cancellation period is over unless you have asked us to do so. You agree that if you access the Site and use the Services within the 14–day cancellation period you have duly authorised us, for the purposes of applicable law, to provide Services to you during this period. In this situation you still have a right to change your mind and cancel the contract during the 14–day cancellation period, however we will be entitled to charge you for the cost of Services provided up to the time you closed your Account. The amount we charge you will be in proportion to our then current monthly fee.</p>
<h3>Termination by us</h3>
<p>We may terminate your contract for Services with us immediately at any time by giving you notice in writing (including email) if you commit a severe breach of any of your obligations under these T&#x26;Cs and, if that breach is capable of remedy, you have failed to remedy that breach within 14 days after receiving written notice (including by email) from us requiring you to remedy that breach.</p>
<p>If you are a business, we may also terminate your contract for Services with us immediately if you are subject to an "Insolvency Event", meaning an event where you are unable to pay your debts (within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986) or become insolvent or an order is made or a resolution passed for your administration, winding-up or dissolution (otherwise than for the purposes of a solvent amalgamation or reconstruction) or an administrative or other receiver, manager, liquidator, administrator, trustee or similar officer is appointed over all or any substantial part of your assets or you enter into or propose any composition or arrangement with your creditors generally or any analogous event occurs in any applicable jurisdiction.</p>
<p>If we terminate your contract for Services with us under this clause 10 your right to access the Services, Applications and/or Documentation under these is T&#x26;Cs shall terminate immediately.</p>
<h3>Your use of the Services</h3>
<p>You may use the Site, Services, Applications and Documentation (our "Assets") provided you do so in accordance with these T&#x26;Cs. However, unless we expressly agree otherwise in writing, you may not:</p>

<p>We reserve the right to monitor usage of our Assets for the purpose of (among others) ensuring compliance with our T&#x26;Cs. We may also instruct third parties to conduct such monitoring on our behalf.
