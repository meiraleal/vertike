doopoll believes that organisations thrive when they understand the people they care about. We build tools and services that help organisations do that better.

We're looking for a Sales Executive to be there at the beginning of our sales team in Cardiff. Whilst we're looking for a junior, you will be given opportunity to grow and potentially lead within the company.

Having won the Sir Michael Moritz Start-up of the Year in 2016 and with investment from Angel and Venture Capital Investors this is an opportunity to have a real impact on a business that is scaling quickly.  

Whilst our sales team is based in Cardiff, doopoll is focused on extensive growth across Europe in 2018, so the role could offer the opportunity for occasional travel. However, the day to day location will be in fantastic offices in central Cardiff.

- Positive, can do attitude
- Quick learner and thinker
- Very well organised
- Learns from mistakes
- Willingness to develop as an all round team member
- Commitment to personal and professional development
- Comfortable leading your own work with guidance

### Desirable requirements
- Fluency in European language/s other than English
- Proof of previous sales success
- Previous experience selling software / SaaS products
- Genuinely enjoys the challenge of meeting and beating targets

### Responsibilities
- Selling doopoll's Plus and Super packages over the phone and Skype video
- Contributing to the sales strategy
- Helping to train colleagues (and be trained by them too)
- Capturing user insights to help develop the product and make it easier to sell
- Representing the business at occasional events
- Keeping doopoll's systems up-to-date with relevant notes and feedback from sales calls

If you would like to apply for the position please send an email to [steve@doopoll.co](mailto:steve@doopoll.co) that explains why you think you would be a good fit for our team. Where possible, include examples of sales roles you've undertaken and performance versus targets, along with a short paragraph on the best book you've read this year.
